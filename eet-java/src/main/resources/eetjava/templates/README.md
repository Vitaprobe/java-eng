#How to get templates
The templates derived from example XML message using xmlsec1 utility. 
The derivation extracts digested byte streams after canonicalization.
The byte streams are then carefully manipulated using string replacements.
Due to carefull manipulation, no advanced XML processing, no c14n, 
no WS-Security tooling is required to generate valid registration request.

There should be no need to re-generate the templates unless the directive of law changes.
